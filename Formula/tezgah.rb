  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Upgrading from 0.1.2: its hooks name the old Cellar/tezgah/0.1.2
      keg, which brew's cleanup deletes. Re-arm once so they name
      opt/tezgah instead:
        tezgah update
      (it re-arms the hosts this install recorded), or
        tezgah-setup --install --hosts <the hosts you armed>
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/tezgah-setup --version")
